    </h3>
<p style="text-align: center";>
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh<br>
Take, take, take it all, but you never give<br>
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss<br>
Had your eyes wide open<br>
Why were they open? (Ooh-ooh)<br>
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash (ooh-ooh)<br>
You tossed it in the trash, you did (ooh-ooh)<br>
To give me all your love is all I ever ask<br>
'Cause what you don't understand is<br>
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Oh, oh, I would go through all this pain<br>
Take a bullet straight through my brain<br>
Yes, I would die for ya, baby<br>
But you won't do the same<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
Uh<br>
Black, black, black and blue<br>
Beat me 'til I'm numb<br>
Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from<br>
Mad woman, bad woman<br>
That's just what you are<br>
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car (ooh-ooh)<br>
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash (ooh-ooh)<br>
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did (ooh-ooh)<br>
To give me all your love is all I ever ask<br>
'Cause what you don't understand is<br>
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Oh oh, I would go through all this pain<br>
Take a bullet straight through my brain<br>
Yes, I would die for ya, baby<br>
But you won't do the same<br>
if my body was on fire<br>
(No) ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames<br>
(No) you said you loved me, you're a liar<br>
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby<br>
But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Ooh-ooh, I would go through all this pain<br>
Take a bullet straight through my brain<br>
Yes, I would die for ya, baby<br>
But you won't do the same<br>
No, you won't do the same<br>
You wouldn't do the same<br>
Ooh, you'd never do the same<br>
No, no, no, no-oh<br>
